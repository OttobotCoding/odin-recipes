    <h2>This meaty goulash recipe is easy to make on the stovetop but can also be done in a slow cooker. Inspired by Paula Deen's Bobby's Goulash.</h2>

    <p>Goulash is a stew made of beef or other meat and vegetables, mostly tomatoes and bell peppers, and generously seasoned with paprika powder. The dish originated in Hungary from where it traveled to other Central European countries and beyond.</p>
        
    <p>As a result, there are countless goulash variations, such as pork goulash, and even goulash made with chicken or turkey.</p>
